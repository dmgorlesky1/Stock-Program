This is a personal project I will be updating in my free time. The final goal will be to allow this to be run when the market opens, 
choose 10 promising stocks that can make me profit, and trade them using different strategies. 

The final product (at the planning stage) will choose 10 potential targets, split off into threads, and trade them or dump them if they
don't do as thought. It will be able to be connected to a trading platform.

**NOTICE**
---------------------------------------
This will be far from perfect, and will only be for entertainment and experience purposes. Any and all trades are simply guess work,
and not professional advice.
