# Stock-Program
This is a personal project that I will be doing in my free time to help me choose stocks that have a chance of increasing in price signicantly.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This project has been halted while I do more research on the market. 
This research will be mainly focused on properly utilizing indicators and techniques to predict market direction, as well as focusing on what 
causes certain stocks to gain value such as Public Relations, Earning Reports, etc.

I will also be doing more research involving the programming aspect as I want this program to implement some form of machine learning to 
accurately decide trades.
